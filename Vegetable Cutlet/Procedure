
 ðŸ¤©Procedure To Make Tasty Vegetable CutletðŸ¤©

Steam or boil veggies until just done. 
Drain any excess moisture if left. 
Mash them well. Add bread crumbs, salt, Chaat masala to the veggies and mix everything well. 
It must be a non-sticky dough. If needed, add more bread crumbs to make it more uniform.
Make 2 small patties and set aside. 
In a separate bowl, make a slightly thin batter of refined flour with water. 
Dip each patty in the batter on both the sides.
Place them on bread crumbs and then keep aside for 5-10 mins so that they dry.
Heat the oil for shallow frying. Fry them on both the sides until golden and crisp. 
ðŸ¥˜Serve veg cutlet hot with dip of your choice.ðŸ¥˜
